## Description

Pcl-analyzer is a framework for testing and analysis various password checking libraries. This framework can load list of passwords, apply several transformations, check these passwords with implemented password checking libraries (CrackLib, PassWDQC, Zxcvbn, Pwscore, Passfault) and analyze their outputs.

The goal of this project is to quantify how well these password checking libraries are against passwords taken from real world data sets of leaked passwords.

This project was specified as RedHat Lab Project by Hubert Kario, the main coordinators of this project are Hubert Kario and Stanislav Židek. Author of code and implementation is Róbert Kolcún

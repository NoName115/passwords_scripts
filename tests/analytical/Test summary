Input file: 'analyticInput'
Each test passed throught two password checking libraries(PCHL) PassWDQC and CrackLib
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Applying no transformations, 1 of the results successfully passed both PCHL
and 4 results successfully passed CrackLib only.

Applying 'CapitalizeAllLetters' or 'LowerAllLetters' transformation,
result was almost identical as applying no transformation.

Applying simple l33t table, almost 70% of passwords successfully passed throught CrackLib,
but this transformation have no effect to PassWSQC.

Apllying advanced l33t table, almost 90% of passwords successfully passed throught CrackLib
and it also significantly increased the number of successfully passed passwords throught PassWDQC library.

The main error was "Bad passphrase (not enough different characters or classes for this length)" generated by PassWDQC library.

Summary,
I suggest to apply random transformation for each character in the password.
